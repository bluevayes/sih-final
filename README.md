Introduction : - 

Managing doctor availability is crucial, especially during emergencies. This web application is designed to optimize the availability and allocation of doctors in real-time. It utilizes a combination of React.js for the front-end, Express.js for the back-end, and a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Features : - 

1. RFID Scanner Integration `
We have integrated RFID scanners as hardware to streamline the process of marking doctors as available in the software database and recording their attendance. When a doctor's RFID card is scanned, their status is updated instantly.

2. Chatbot Assistance `
Our web application features a chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLM). Users can interact with the chatbot to describe their symptoms, and it will provide remedies and suggest available doctors based on the database information.

3. Real-time Updates `
The system provides real-time updates by continuously fetching and updating data from the MySQL database, ensuring that the information displayed to users is always accurate.

4. Emergency Services `
We plan to integrate an emergency button that users can activate in case of medical emergencies. This feature will initiate a call to the nearest hospital and simultaneously alert the ambulance service. This functionality operates in real-time, ensuring rapid response in critical situations.
